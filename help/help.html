    <h1>Rules of the game "Flappy Bird"</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Guide the bird through narrow gaps between green pipes without colliding with them or the ground to achieve the highest score possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Control the bird's flight by pressing the "Up arrow" key or the spacebar. Each tap will make the bird flap its wings, propelling it upwards. Release the key to allow the bird to descend naturally.</li>
      <li><strong>Pipes and Gaps:</strong> Pipes appear from the top and bottom of the screen, leaving a small gap in between. Your mission is to navigate the bird through these gaps without hitting the pipes.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Successfully passing through a gap earns you 1 point. Aim to collect as many points as possible to set a new high score.</li>
      <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> The game gets progressively harder as you score more points. The gaps between pipes become narrower, requiring precise timing and control.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> he game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. After that, you can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button to improve your score.</li>      
      <li><strong>High Score:</strong> Your highest score will be saved locally, allowing you to compete with yourself and challenge your friends to beat your record.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Flappy Bird may seem challenging at first, but with practice and determination, you can master the art of navigating the bird through the pipes.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> Flappy Bird is a fun and addictive game designed to test your reflexes and concentration. Embrace the challenge and see how far you can go!</li>
