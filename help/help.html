      <ul class="help__rules-list">
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Objective:</strong> Guide the bird through
          narrow gaps between green pipes without colliding with them or the ground to achieve the highest score
          possible.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Controls:</strong> Control the bird's flight
          by pressing the "Up arrow" key or the spacebar. Each tap will make the bird flap its wings, propelling it
          upwards. Release the key to allow the bird to descend naturally.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Pipes and Gaps:</strong> Pipes appear from
          the top and bottom of the screen, leaving a small gap in between. Your mission is to navigate the bird through
          these gaps without hitting the pipes.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Scoring:</strong> Successfully passing
          through a gap earns you 1 point. Aim to collect as many points as possible to set a new high score.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Difficulty:</strong> The game gets
          progressively harder as you score more points. The gaps between pipes become narrower, requiring precise
          timing and control.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">Game Over:</strong> The game ends when the
          bird collides with a pipe or the ground. After that, you can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button
          to improve your score.</li>
        <li class="help__rules-item"><strong class="help__rules-item-title">High Score:</strong> Your highest score will
          be saved locally, allowing you to compete with yourself and challenge your friends to beat your record.</li>
